# React Weather App

The idea was to build a project that is simple, but still shows my ability to work with APIs, manage state in React, and design a user-friendly UI.  

---

##  I Built This Application 
- To demonstrate my knowledge of **React functional components and hooks**.  
- To show that I can **fetch live API data** and handle it properly in an app.  
- To highlight my ability to **handle errors** (like blank input, wrong city, or network issues).  
- To present a project with a **modern and responsive design** that looks little bit professional.  



## Key Features I Included
- Search weather by city name.  
- **Celsius ↔ Fahrenheit toggle** for usability.  
- Weather codes converted into **easy-to-understand emojis** .  
- Wind speed details included.  
- Loading state + error messages so the app feels complete.  
- Glassmorphism UI with background overlay + responsive design.  

## My Focus Areas in This Project 
- I pay attention to user experience (not just raw data).  
- I think about dge cases and error handling.  
- I like building apps that are **simple, clean, and reliable**.  
- I can explain my **design decisions** clearly.  


*This app may be small, but it’s a good example of how I approach coding: clear logic, clean UI, and thinking about the user as well as the code.*
